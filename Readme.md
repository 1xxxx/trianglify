# Trianglify 2.0 Branch

Rewrite progress:
- build system is sort of working (browserify builds with standalone export)
- tests are written, but not currently being run as a part of builds
- svg generation is working well
- color gradients are SUPER BUGGED
- index.js definitely needs aggressive refactoring
